Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/meltyli/discord-dm-manager/wiki) to learn how to use this tool.

This script is intended to be used in tandem with [Discord Chat Exporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/).

# Roadmap/Future features
- add env file for better security
- add choosing a script file for using with Discord Chat Exporter(?)
- since punycode is discontinued, it should be replaced with something current
