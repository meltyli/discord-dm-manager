Discord Direct Message Manager revamped by melty. This script is intended to be used in tandem with [Discord Chat Exporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/).

### Roadmap/Future features:
- ✅~~add env file for better security~~
- add choosing a script file for using with Discord Chat Exporter(?)
- ✅~~since punycode is discontinued, it should be replaced with something current~~
- ✅~~update wiki to be in line with current features~~
- ✅~~add error checking when .env file does not exist or broken~~
- add deleted user checker to skip if user is deleted
- only open a safe number of messages each batch `{max limit(~150)} - {some buffer(10)} - {count of open group chats}`
